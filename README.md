# AutoLedger
AutoLedger is a blockchain based record to explicitly know everything about your car.
Currently it gives details about the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
The future prospects AutoLedger are to track information about Non-EV:
Car service/repair history

and other than this, a different segment will be created for tracking information about electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid vehicles.

Why AutoLedger?
Detailed record keeping.
Enhanced transpareny.
Efficient service management.
Streamlined insurance claims.
Environmental compliance.
Resale value optimisation.
